## Installing Python and Pandas 

###Â Mac OS / Linux

Before the session, please make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed. Here are the instructions if you need to install it.


* You need python installed in your laptop. Click on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for more info based on the OS you work with.

* To install these packages you tipically use pip or anaconda:

Using pip (for python 2.7 use pip instead of pip3)

```
> pip3 install pandas
> pip3 install scipy
> pip3 install jupyter
```
Using Anaconda

```
> conda install pandas
> conda install scipy
> conda install jupyter
```

### Windows installation

Before the session, please make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed. Here are the instructions if you need to install it.


* You  download [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/), a distribution of Python packages that contains all you need for running Python on Windows. It has all the libraries you need already pre-loaded.


## Getting the  code

* You can either download the repository zip file, or clone the repository.
* Run the example [example.ipynb](/notebooks/example.ipynb) using ipython or jupyter notebooks on your laptop. If it runs, you are all set!

If you are familiar with git

```
> git clone https://github.com/sgonzalez/wwc-visualization
> jupyter notebook introduction/example.ipynb
```

If you want to download the zipfile

```
> Download https://github.com/sgonzalez/wwc-visualization/archive/master.zip
> unzip the file
> go to where you unzipped the file
